# Algorithms - Python

Algorithms are implemented using pure python. I have written codes for different algorithms when I first started to learn them. 

Used [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) for reference while learning. A special thanks to the focks contributing in above mention repo.
